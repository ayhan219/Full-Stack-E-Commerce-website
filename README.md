# Project Description

"In this project, various technologies were utilized to build a comprehensive e-commerce website. React was used for the frontend to create a dynamic and interactive user interface, while Node.js and Express.js served as the backend framework for handling server-side operations. MySQL was chosen as the database to store product and user information. For secure user authentication, JWT (JSON Web Token) was implemented, and cookies were used for session management. The project incorporates essential features for an e-commerce platform, including product browsing, cart functionality, and order processing."
