# Project Description

"In this project, various technologies were utilized to build a comprehensive e-commerce website. React was used for the frontend to create a dynamic and interactive user interface, while Node.js and Express.js served as the backend framework for handling server-side operations. MySQL was chosen as the database to store product and user information. For secure user authentication, JWT (JSON Web Token) was implemented, and cookies were used for session management. The project incorporates essential features for an e-commerce platform, including product browsing, cart functionality, and order processing."

Once a user finds a desired product, they can add it to their shopping cart to proceed with the purchase or save it to their favorites for later. The favorites feature enables users to keep a list of products they are interested in, making it easy to revisit them without having to search again. Additionally, the shopping cart provides a seamless checkout experience, where users can review their selected items, adjust quantities, or remove products before finalizing the order.

When a product is added to the shopping cart, the total price is automatically calculated, providing users with an up-to-date overview of their purchase costs. The cart dynamically updates as items are added or removed, ensuring that the displayed total always reflects the current contents. If users decide they no longer want certain products, they have the option to remove specific items from the cart, allowing for easy modifications to their order before proceeding to checkout.

The platform also incorporates authentication features, allowing users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their personal information. Registered users can access a personalized dashboard where they can view their order history, manage favorite products, and track ongoing orders. The site employs token-based authentication (JWT) and cookies to ensure that user sessions are managed securely.

This e-commerce project covers all the necessary functionalities for an online shopping experience, with a strong focus on usability, security, and a responsive design that works across different devices.
